## Introduction
Reinsurance involves managing complex datasets such as claims, policies, and treaty exposures.  
We compare **imperative programming** (explicit orchestration) with **declarative programming** (SDP-managed orchestration).

👉 For detailed code examples, see the [SDP Examples](docs/sdp.md).
